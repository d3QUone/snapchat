<b>Multiplatform set of Snapchat SMM scripts</b>

In short, the current sample script takes Picture from settings-file and sends it to all friends on accounts in input-file, using proxies from proxies-file. This was the first version. 

I can do for you at least custom:
- friend-to-friend reposting
- posting to the story
- followers managing 
- different analyses
- income filter (by usernames and by content)


Uncluded in all customisations:
- proxy support
- account managing
- human behavior
